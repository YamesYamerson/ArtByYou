Iteration 2:

In this iteration, there is added functionality to the artist.php and collections_T.php, and created an aboutArtist.php, themes.php, and post.php page.

artist.php - now has dynamic images which are added based on the contents of artist.csv file and images in the files/artists directory

collections_T.php - now has dynamic images which are added based on contents of themes.csv file and images in the files/themes directory

aboutArtist.php - when user selects artist from artist page, a query string navigates them to their personal page which uses allData.csv and the other folders and images in the files/ directory to populate the page with their art

themes.php - when a user selects a specific collection from the collections_T.php page they are navigated to that theme's page using a querystring. Themes is then populated with all files in allData.csv that match that theme

post.php - form entry page that allows users to post to allData.csv form by providing name, title, theme, and file information. The POST information is then stored to the last line in allData.csv when the users pushes the submit button
